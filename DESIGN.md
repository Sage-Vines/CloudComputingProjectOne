**1. Overview** <br>
This project implements a simple REST web service that converts weight from pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg). The web service is deployed on an Amazon EC2 AMI instance and is accessable via an HTTP GET request. This get request uses the /convert endpoint. For example, "/convert?lbs=150" would be part of a valid HTTP GET request. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the proper provisioning of a secure cloud VM in Amazon AWS, deploy a reliable REST API, and apply basic DevOps practices for the web service.
